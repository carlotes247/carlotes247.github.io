Hi, my name is Carlos Gonzalez Diaz. Welcome to my humble site! :D

First, don't forget to check my [publications](https://carlotes247.github.io/publications/)

Then, go follow me on twitter at [@Carlotes247](http://www.twitter.com/carlotes247). I share a lot of sciency and techy stuff there that I enjoy. I can be a source of interesting AI, Machine Learning, VR, Games and HCI tweets/retweets! 

Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlosglesdiaz/) if you want something more professional. Disclaimer: *it can be outdated*.

You can also email me to carlosglesdiaz (at) gmail (dot) com.
If you fancy my academic emails, you can choose between:
- cgd506 (at) york (dot) ac.uk
- c.gonzalezdiaz (at) gold (dot) ac.uk

This is a very lightweight website and the idea is show some of my research and work. Bear in mind that I am a massive nerd and you are going to see things about tech, videogames, VR, psychology and even neuroscience! 

And if you are interested, here you can find a bit about myself :) Don't forget to check my [PhD profile](http://www.iggi.org.uk/students/2016/carlos-gonzalez-diaz/) as well

# BIO

My interest and passion for videogame development started by studying a BSc in Software Engineering at the Rey Juan Carlos University (Madrid, Spain), where I learned from the talented VR and Haptic Research Group and developed my own VR fire arm training serious game. 

Following my education, I obtained an MSc in Serious Games at the University of Skövde (Skövde, Sweden), working together with the Swedish game company IUS Innovation for his MSc Thesis. I started a second MSc in Digital Narration: Game and Cultural Heritage at the same institution and worked in a Swedish interregional transmedia AR game project. 

I exhibited an art videogame with a focus on embodied interaction both in Sweden and Denmark; and participated in the vibrant Scandinavian game development scene, prototyping games and working with great people from all over the world at several game jams and hackathons.

Now, I pursue my ambition of improving the next generation of games R&D at the leading Intelligent Games and Games Intelligence (IGGI) Centre for Doctoral Training across 4 UK universities (http://www.iggi.org.uk/). My work led me to collaborate with Sony Interactive Entertainment R&D West division during my PhD, and to participate in the development of a [Google-funded interactive machine learning project](http://interactml.com/) together with experts from Goldsmiths, University of London. 

The last project I mentioned is what I am currently working on. You can check it out at [InteractML.com](http://interactml.com/). I am researching how game developers can create motion control schemes using the power of machine learning. Since it is a very novel and exciting topic there are lots of applications and unanswered questions. You can use InteractML to create more expressive VR interactions, control your game with your webcam, or even use your custom hacked-together input interface! But still there are many things that we don't know... What kind of control schemes can be created with machine learning? And game mechanics? What are the ones that work best? And what is the effect on the player experience? 

Those are the questions I am trying to answer in what is left of my PhD. Have an eye on this website for more information on how that goes :)
