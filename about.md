This is a very lightweight website and the idea is to expand it a lot with all my doctoral research and projects.

In the mean time, here you have a bit of myself :)

My interest and passion for videogame development started by studying a BSc in Software Engineering at the Universidad Rey Juan Carlos (Madrid, Spain), where I learned from the talented VR and Haptic Research Group and developed my own VR fire arm training serious game. 

Following my education, I obtained an MSc in Serious Games at the University of Skövde (Skövde, Sweden), working together with the Swedish game company IUS Innovation for his MSc Thesis. I started a second MSc in Digital Narration: Game and Cultural Heritage at the same institution and worked in a Swedish interregional transmedia AR game project. 

I exhibited an art videogame with a focus on embodied interaction both in Sweden and Denmark; and participated in the vibrant Scandinavian game development scene, prototyping games and working with great people from all over the world at several game jams and hackathons.

Now, I puruse my ambition of improving the next generation of games R&D at the leading Intelligent Games and Games Intelligence (IGGI) Centre for Doctoral Training across 4 UK universities (http://www.iggi.org.uk/). My work led me to collaborate with Sony Interactive Entertainment R&D West division during my PhD, and to participate in the development of a Google-funded interactive machine learning project together with experts from Goldsmiths, University of London.
