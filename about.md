# BIO

My interest and passion for videogame development started by studying a *BSc in Software Engineering* at the Rey Juan Carlos University (Madrid, Spain), where I learned from the talented VR and Haptic Research Group and developed my own VR fire arm training serious game. I was lucky enough to get a *dictinction* in my final project!

Following my education, I obtained an *MSc in Serious Games* at the University of Skövde (Skövde, Sweden), working together with the Swedish game company IUS Innovation for my MSc Thesis. I started a second *MSc in Digital Narration: Game and Cultural Heritage* at the same institution and worked in a Swedish interregional transmedia AR game project. 

I exhibited an art videogame with a focus on embodied interaction both in Sweden and Denmark; and participated in the vibrant Scandinavian game development scene, prototyping games and working with great people from all over the world at several game jams and hackathons.

Now, I am doing my *PhD* and pursuing my ambition of improving the next generation of games R&D at the leading *Intelligent Games and Games Intelligence (IGGI) Centre for Doctoral Training* across 4 UK universities (http://www.iggi.org.uk/). My work led me to collaborate with Sony Interactive Entertainment R&D West division during my PhD, and to participate in the development of a [Google-funded interactive machine learning project](http://interactml.com/) together with experts from Goldsmiths, University of London. 

The last project I mentioned is what I am currently working on. You can check it out at [InteractML.com](http://interactml.com/). I am researching how game developers can create motion control schemes using the power of machine learning. Since it is a very novel and exciting topic there are lots of applications and unanswered questions. You can use InteractML to create more expressive VR interactions, control your game with your webcam, or even use your custom hacked-together input interface! But still there are many things that we don't know... What kind of control schemes can be created with machine learning? And game mechanics? What are the ones that work best? And what is the effect on the player experience? 

Those are the questions I am trying to answer in what is left of my PhD. Have an eye on this website for more information on how that goes :)
