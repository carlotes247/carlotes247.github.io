<p>Hi!
  
  Welcome to my site. Please excuse the simplicity, but I'm working on it to make it look better :)
  
  In the meantime, I can tell you a bit about my academic research and my work in the games industry!
  
  I am a PhD Student at the University of York, UK. My PhD is part of this really amazing programme called Intelligent Games and Games Intelligence (IGGI)
