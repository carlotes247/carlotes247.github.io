Hi! 

Welcome to my site. Please excuse the simplicity, but I'm working on it to make it look better :) 

In the meantime, I can tell you a bit about my academic research and my work in the games industry! 
I am a PhD Student at the University of York, UK. My PhD is part of this really amazing programme called Intelligent Games and Games Intelligence ([IGGI](http://www.iggi.org.uk/)) between the University of York, Goldsmiths University of London, Queen Mary University of London and the University of Essex.

Motion controls are experiencing a renaissance in current Virtual Reality (VR) games, yet there are no standard practices how to design motion control schemes. Interactive machine learning has been successfully used to allow designers and end users to 'fine-tune' or even design wholly personal control schemes for interactive music and other applications. Could these techniques be used for motion controls in games?
 
My research explores how using interactive machine learning techniques in the design of motion control schemes of digital games can improve the player experience. Specifically, I am interested in how end-users may use interactive machine learning to design enjoyable motion control schemes for themselves, and how this compares to control schemes crafted by expert designers.
