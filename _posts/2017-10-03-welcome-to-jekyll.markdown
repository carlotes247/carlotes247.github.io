Hi! 

Welcome to my site. Please excuse the simplicity, but I'm working on it to make it look better :) 

In the meantime, I can tell you a bit about my academic research and my work in the games industry! 
I am a PhD Student at the University of York, UK. My PhD is part of this really amazing programme called Intelligent Games and Games Intelligence ([IGGI](http://www.iggi.org.uk/)).

And this blog should expand a lot!
